This paper was about the use of storytelling in visualizations to help in communicating information, which has been found to be helpful, but takes it to a new level in analyzing which genres of story are most effective: For instance, scrollytelling, slideshow, etc. Having these kinds of options available to patients in general would be really helpful for many in my opinion, as not everyone processes information in the same manner. The study found that most people were more in tune with the slideshow form, which makes sense to me as slideshows and powerpoint presentations have become commonplace. Meanwhile, scrolling on a computer is usually saved for a single article or single page interaction, and scrolling may not come naturally when looking at a slide-seperated topic. However, scrolling and swiping is much more natural on a phone, which is now becoming more and more common for people to have, in place of a computer. Thus, having a slide-based version of events in an office may be better, but for patients viewing on a mobile device, having a completely different interface could be really helpful. Overall, based on the study and the issues the user study individuals had, it sounds as though the slideshow and the scrollytelling were not professionally made. From this angle, hospitals may wish to hire individuals with more graphic design skills to produce better visualizations, or create software that would help medical professionals make visualizations. However on the flip side of this, if they are not willing to do this, it may be better to stick to slideshows, as these are easier to make and less reliant on design or coding skills.
