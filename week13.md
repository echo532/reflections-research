This paper documents the creation of a data visualization system for a space program mission, with the goal of seperating each of its components into reasonable boxes so that mission control can quickly determine the cause and location of a problem, in the case that one arises. It actually stretches beyond a pure visualization system and also sends instructions, but it has the ability to quickly display information. I think this system is useful, but its use is a little limited, as generally when things go catastrophically wrong on a spacecraft, there is not much that can be done. I think that this would be better implemented, instead of per mission, as a large scale space program utility that can track progress across the systems, and make it possible to judge progress across a broad slew of metrics. The visualization system has implemented a number of "widgets" or independent proof of concept ideas that could be expanded into further functionality. I think that these widgets could be easily expanded to encompass most of a space programs' systems, and create viewable data constantly that could be good not only for ground controllers, but also PR content and for communicating mission progress with the general public. If this is the goal, the data visualization systems would have to be modernized somewhat, which I think would benefit their general users, as the software seems in need of general update and quality improvement.
