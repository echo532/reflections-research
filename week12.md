This paper looks into possibilities of applying data visualization techniques and research to help with military application, in a variety of different ways. These involve from communication information up and down the chain of command, to actually helping at a tactical and strategic level. I think that, barring moral qualifications, the nature of warfare has progressed to the point where many confrontations will be fought entirely by artificial intelligence, and that commanders and troops need to have ways of quantifying what exactly is going on. To that end, a couple of maps in the paper would be helpful for military personnel to have access to. However I think they focus too much on establishing a photoreal image of the battlefield, as well as angling towards holographic technology or augmented reality. The fact is, screens are more than adequate to display information, and some info is better suited to a simplistic image: for instance, a forest being represented as a green blob. At the speed warfare currently moves at, visualizations need to communicate info as quickly as possible, for quick action and reaction to be possible. This is slightly different for visualizations used by troops in the field, as they may need more information than commanders, but avoiding information overflow is crucial for any troop-based system, so that soldiers don't get bogged down in information that they miss the big picture, or miss opportunities. Additionally, with the invasion of Ukraine, the reality of modern-day information warfare is becoming clear - while there is a lot of information conveyed through drones and satellites, the enemy can use technologies to disrupt drones and information gathering techniques. Thus any military visualizations need to be able to clearly convey places where information is lacking, so that commanders don't make any decisions based on information they think they might know.
