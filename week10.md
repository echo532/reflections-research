This paper I found described the use of public government data in data visualization, which i think is very relevant to the final project I am doing of creating a map. The paper talks about a study conducted on the literature surrounding government data, and found examples of its use for visualizations; it found that the majority of the data was used for transportation and maps were the most common visualization feature. I think this  study is useful as an introduction to what data is being used for. However, as it refers to only 24 different use cases, either the use of government data is very limited, or this study is not large enough to understand all of its uses. Still it provides examples of studies using data for genuinely complicated and interesting visualizations, and I think that a lot more can be used if people branch out like some of the graphs here. Additionally, this study talked about how problems with the datasets made it difficult to use; for instance, poor data quality led to incomplete records and an inability to complete proper analysis. This is an issue I have already encountered on the final project - some countries will not publish data sets of potentially classified things and it can ruin all the analysis. I think this is an issue only because the use of government data is very limited, and often buried in hard to reach and understand places. If graphs of the data become more widespread, infrastructure surrounding it will grow, and open source tools created by talented programmers will make it easier to access and use the data provided by governments; governments will be as well motivated to spend more time on their figures if they are being used more. Overall, the solution to most of the problems outlined in the paper is increased exposure and investment.
